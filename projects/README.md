## Project 5 and 6

### Computation set-up

Please follow instructions on Coiled at: https://github.com/obidam/ds2-2025/blob/main/practice/environment/coiled/README.md 

### Project 5: Ocean warming
 
Get all the details and a starter notebook here:

### Project 6: Ocean warming contribution to Sea level rise
 
*Description*: Sea level increases because of changes in currents (dynamic effect) and because of ocean density changes (steric effect). Compute ocean density changes contribution to Sea level rises (thermosteric effect) and demonstrate that it is the driver of regional sea level change trends.

[Overview](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/overview), [Deep-ocean contribution to sea level and energy budget not detectable over the past decade](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2387), [Last IPCC report on Sea Level changes](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter_09.pdf#page=55), [IPCC fig 9.12](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter_09.pdf#page=237)

*Data*: You can use the [EN4 dataset](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/en4/) that is an interpolation of all available ocean observations (of temperature and salinity) onto a regular space/time grid.

This dataset can be accessed this way:
    
    from intake import open_catalog
    catalog_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obidam/ds2-2025/main/ds2_data_catalog.yml'
    cat = open_catalog(catalog_url)
    ds = cat["en4"].to_dask()

**Sea Level data** accessible on the catalog as well here:

    ds = cat["sea_surface_height"].to_dask()

You should also need GSW: https://teos-10.github.io/GSW-Python/

## Projects 7 and 8: Future Arctic sea ice change (Arctic) / the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation

*Description*: The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project is a framework within which a number of research centres produce predictions of the future evolution of the climate. Many climate centres use an ensemble approach, in which they produce several simulations for each scenario, using the same model configuration. By comparing these multiple simulations (â€œthe ensemble"), we can estimate the probability that the climate will evolve in a certain way.

*Data*: Google host a part of these data via their Public Datasets programme (https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/new-climate-model-data-now-google-public-datasets).

This dataset can be accessed this way:

	df = pd.read_csv('https://storage.googleapis.com/cmip6/cmip6-zarr-consolidated-stores.csv')
	df_ssh = df.query("activity_id=='ScenarioMIP' & table_id == 'Omon' & variable_id == 'zos' & institution_id == 'IPSL'")
	gcs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem(token='anon')
	zstore = df_ssh.zstore.values[-1]
	mapper = gcs.get_mapper(zstore)
	ds = xr.(mapper, consolidated=True)
